    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: 2025</strong></p>

      This Privacy Policy describes how our website collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you visit our website.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      This website is designed purely for informational and promotional
      purposes. The only data we collect is non-personal information through
      Google Analytics and Google Ads conversion tracking, which helps us
      understand traffic and ad performance. This data does not personally
      identify you. It may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pages visited and time spent on the site.</li>
      <li>Referral sources (e.g., from a Google search ad).</li>
      <li>General location data (country, city).</li>
      <li>Browser type and device information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We use cookies solely for the purpose of affiliate tracking and website
      analytics (via Google Analytics and Google Ads). These cookies help us
      identify if a visitor came from our advertisement and subsequently
      completed a conversion on the official product's website. These cookies
      are not used to collect personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Affiliate Disclosure</h2>

      commission on successful sales. We do not handle your order, payment, or
      shipping. All such transactions are processed securely on the official
      product website, operated by its manufacturer.
